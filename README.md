The library instructor reflection response data is a data set that was created by Heather Back for the purpose of using it in her data management class as a part of a data preservation project.
The made-up survey was created by Heather because of her research interest, library instruction and reflective teaching practices.
The responses were all made by Heather to create data for this class project.
In the future, Heather hopes to use this survey in her career as an academic librarian, with interests in instruction design and assessment planning.
